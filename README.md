# pdfmole

This package is a rewrite from the **R** package 
[pdfmole](https://github.com/FlorianSchwendinger/pdfmole)
to put some **Python** scripts originally stored in the **R** package into
a dedicated **Python** package.

## Motivation
Working with **pdfminer** I recognized that **pdfminer** is great in
extracting information from pdf-files but especially for spreadsheet like data 
in many cases it possible to get better results by refining the results
with specialized scripts.

## Examples
- [Basic usage]()

## Installation
### Imports (packages needed to use pdfmole)
- [`pdfminer.six`](https://github.com/pdfminer/pdfminer.six)
### Suggests (packages needed to use optional functionality)

## TODO:
- write docs
- extend examples and clustering options
